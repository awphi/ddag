- Setup a sandbox and some examples in @ddag/site
- Write some docs
- Generate an API reference w/ typedoc-plugin-markdown and relevant docusaurus plugin
- Publish package on npm w/ GH action

- Foundation in place - now time work on extension!
  - Use wtx
  - Comms structure is @ddag/core <-(window.postMessage/window.addEventListener('message'))-> content script -(browser.runtime.onMessage)-> devtools script
  - Make it typesafe!
  - Think about how this will be distributed - two builds of @ddag/core?
  - Think about protocol - maybe an RPC pattern would make things easier so we can surgically update a mirror copy of the graph matched via the unique numeric node/graph IDs
